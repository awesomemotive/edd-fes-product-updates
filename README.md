# FES Product Updates

Connects the [Product Updates](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/product-updates/) extension to [Frontend Submissions](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/frontend-submissions/) to allow vendors to send email updates to their customers.

All email creation and sending are handled through the Product Updates extension. This bridge plugin simply provides a simple interface for creating emails from the vendor dashboard.

A new tab will be added to the Vendor's Dashboard called `Email Customers`. On this page, vendors can draft an email that will be sent to their customers. The vendor can define the subject and message of the email and they can select which products the email should be sent to customers of.

In `Downloads > Settings > Emails`, site admins can define default content that is appended to the bottom of all vendor emails. Site admins can also select the template tags that are displayed to vendors.

When a vendor creates an email, it is submitted as a draft and then site admins are notified of the new email so they can review and process it.
